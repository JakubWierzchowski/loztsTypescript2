This is a refreshed version of the previous website (currently www.lozts.pl), which has been developed using Next.js and TypeScript. The project is hosted on a private VPS server with a custom Nginx configuration. In addition to the updated graphics, when logged in as an administrator, you can find features such as:
<ol>
  <li>Adding files and saving them as JSON with placement in a local folder.</li>
    <li>CRUD operations for posts using JSON.</li>
    <li>CRUD operations for posts (including images) using Firebase.</li>
    <li>A timer that determines the time frame for adding/removing players in a specific tournament.</li>
  <li>Gallery</li>
</ol>

These features are accessible only from the administrator's account. Below are some images showing how it looks in practice:

To make the project work correctly, you need to create a Firebase account and run the command npm install.
